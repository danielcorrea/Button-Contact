{"name":"Button - Contact","tagline":"Free Editor Contact Button","body":"### Welcome to Joomla Button Contact site.\r\nIf you work with Joomla it is possible that at some point need to insert a link to a contact directly within an article or module.\r\n\r\nBy default Joomla does not include this option. It forces us to copy the URL for a contact from a menu created anteiormente. What causes loss of time and resources.\r\n\r\nThis plugin eliminates the need for this and offers a menu button next to the text editor that allows the automatic creation of a link to the contact.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n@danielcorrea - http://danielcorrrea.me\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
